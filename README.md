## Lil Bit Introduction
ReikutsuNeko here. I have several nicknames like Rei/Ruru (you can call me with whatever comfy). I'm a dev and also an artist. At the moment, to expand my expertise and keep learning stuffs I like, I decided to make a web portfolio. Before I forgot, meet my mascot called Nekogi!! He is the one who actually made this website ~~just kidding orz~~.

My plan is to make this project as my portfolio and also as a hub for my other personal projects. Ok, thank you for checking and nice to meet you! Feel free to contact me if you want to collab or do something together.
